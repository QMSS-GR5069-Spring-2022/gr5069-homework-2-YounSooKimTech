## Logistic Regression Model and Decision Tree Model Practice

### Language
This notebook used **Python** as it language. 

### Dataset
This code notebook used **red wine** dataset from https://bit.ly/wine_csv_data.

### Models
We used **1) logistic regression model** and **2) decision tree model** to predict the wine quality. 
In this notebook, we also used standard scaler and hyperparameter to have higher precision score, avoid overfitting, and perform better.
